    - How did the name Ida change period-over-period in California?
    - What name is most unisex?
    - What names on the national level are too scarce on the state level?

- A data pipeline for Exporting data from the provided dataset, Transforming them and Loading them to the database regularly.

- An intuitive analytical dashboard to visualize insights such as:
